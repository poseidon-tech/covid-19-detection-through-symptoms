# covid-19-detection-through-symptoms
The created hack is a web application that relies on user input. It displays a list of symptoms that the user may be experiencing and might mistake for Covid-19. The received input will be evaluated based on a machine learning model, and their probability will be displayed to them. The person is advised to see a doctor if the likelihood is high or severe. His input will be kept in the machine learning system. Based on this, the tests can be prioritised in order to lessen disease transmission and make the most of the limited testing capacity in a nation with such a large population as India.
